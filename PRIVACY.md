## Third-Party Services

### Brandfetch API (Optional)

If you choose to enable store logo fetching:
- You must provide your own Brandfetch API client ID
- When viewing expenses with store information, the app makes API calls to Brandfetch to fetch store logos
- Only the store website URL is sent to Brandfetch
- No personal financial data is sent to Brandfetch
- You can disable this feature at any time by removing your API key from Settings

**This is the ONLY external service that receives any data from the app, and it is entirely optional.**

## Data You Control

### Export Your Data

You can export all your data at any time:
1. Go to Settings

The export includes ALL your data in a human-readable JSON format.

## Data Security

- **Device Security:** Your data security depends on your device's security (lock screen, encryption, etc.)
